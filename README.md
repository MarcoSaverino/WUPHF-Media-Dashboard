# WUPHF - MEDIA DASHBOARD

Our group created a Media Dashboard. The web application entails incorporating social media feeds which can be displayed. Landing page was created with the input for ‘sign up’ and incorporate it to handlebars. Initial thought was to feed Instagram and Twitter in the website but we had to drop the idea because of the difficulty engulfing around the permissions required.
